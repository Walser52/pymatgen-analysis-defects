    "\n",
    "A persistent challenge with organizing computational defect data is the ambiguity with which a defect simulation is defined.\n",
    "The standard practice is to simulate the isolated defects by using a larger simultion to create an isolated defect and then using charge-state corrections to approximate the properties of a defect in the dilute limit.\n",
    "This means that the same defect can be simulated with different simulation cells.\n",
    "Ideally, if you want to build a computational defects database you will need some way to check if different simulations represent the same defect.\n",
    "\n",
    "A core concept in this packge is that a defect is defined indepently of the simultion cell.\n",
    "All of the information about which defect we are simulating is captured by the `Defect` object.\n",
    "A point defect is defined by the Wigner-Seitz cell representation of the bulk material stored as a `structure` attribute,\n",
    "and a `site` attribute that indicates where the defect is in the unit cell.\n",
    "Different kinds of point defects all subclass the `Defect` objects which gives easy access to functions such as generating a cubic simulation supercell.\n",
    "As along as the database or any algorithm keeps track of this `Defect` object, you can just use simple structure matching to find out if two simulations represent the same defect.\n"
